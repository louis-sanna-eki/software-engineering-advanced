# Naming Conventions

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton

Good naming is crucial for code readability and maintainability. Well-chosen names act as documentation, reducing the need for comments and making your code self-explanatory. They can convey purpose, behavior, and relationships between different parts of your code. Poor naming, on the other hand, can lead to confusion, bugs, and increased development time.

## General Principles

1. Be descriptive yet concise
2. Use English words
3. Follow Python's conventions
4. Be consistent throughout your project

In English, adjectives usually come before nouns, and we put the most important noun at the end of a phrase. This practice makes our code more natural and readable:

```python
# Good - adjective before noun
active_users = [...]
pending_orders = [...]
encrypted_password = "..."

# Bad - adjective after noun
users_active = [...]
orders_pending = [...]
password_encrypted = "..."
```

## Naming Conventions

### 1. Variables and Functions

Use lowercase with underscores for readability. The larger the scope, the more descriptive the name should be.

```python
# Good
user_name = "John Doe"
calculate_total = lambda x, y: x + y

# Bad
UserName = "John Doe"
calculateTotal = lambda x, y: x + y
```

For dictionaries, name them by their values and keys:
```python
# Good
score_by_username = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87}  # describes what the dict maps
settings_by_category = {"display": {...}, "audio": {...}}

# Bad
score_dict = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87}  # just adds '_dict' suffix
settings = {"display": {...}, "audio": {...}}  # too vague
```

For booleans, use positive predicates with prefixes like 'is_', 'has_', 'should_':
```python
# Good
is_valid = True
has_permission = False
should_retry = True

# Bad
not_invalid = True  # double negative
permission = True   # not clear it's a boolean
retry = True       # verb could be confused with action
```

For lists and dictionaries, consider using plural nouns:

```python
# Good
active_users = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
scores_by_user = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87, "Charlie": 92}

# Bad
user_list = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
score_dict = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87, "Charlie": 92}
```

For functions, consider using verbs to describe actions:

```python
# Good
def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Bad
def average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

### 2. Classes

Use CapWords (or CamelCase) convention.

```python
# Good
class UserProfile:
    pass

# Bad
class user_profile:
    pass
```

### 3. Constants

Use all uppercase with underscores.

```python
# Good
MAX_OVERFLOW = 100
TOTAL = 1000

# Bad
MaxOverflow = 100
total = 1000
```

### 4. Modules and Packages

Use short, lowercase names. Underscores can be used if it improves readability.

```python
# Good
import utility_functions
from data_processing import clean_data

# Bad
import UtilityFunctions
from DataProcessing import CleanData
```

### 5. Private Variables and Methods

Use a leading underscore for non-public methods and instance variables.

```python
# Good
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._private_var = 42
    
    def _private_method(self):
        pass

# Bad
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.privateVar = 42
    
    def privateMethod(self):
        pass
```

### 6. Magic Methods

Use double underscores for Python special methods (also known as dunder methods).

```python
# Good
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "MyClass instance"

# Bad
class MyClass:
    def init(self):
        pass
    
    def string(self):
        return "MyClass instance"
```

Remember, the goal of these conventions is to make your code more readable and maintainable. While following these rules, also ensure that your names are descriptive and convey the purpose or behavior of the entity they represent. Always prioritize clarity and understandability in your naming choices.

## Advanced Principles

### Making Magic Numbers Meaningful
Convert important numbers into named constants:
```python
# Bad
if password_length < 8:
    raise ValueError("Too short")

# Good
MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 8
MAXIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 64
PASSWORD_EXPIRE_DAYS = 90

if password_length < MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH:
    raise ValueError("Too short")
```

### Precise Over Generic Names
Avoid generic names that don't convey meaning:
```python
# Bad
data = get_user_info()  # What kind of data?
process_items(items)    # What items?

# Good
user_profile = get_user_info()
process_pending_orders(orders)
```

### Positive Over Negative Names
Avoid double negatives and prefer positive conditions:
```python
# Bad
if not is_not_valid:
    proceed()

# Good
if is_valid:
    proceed()
```
